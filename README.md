SPICE simulation of a pseudo-memcapacitive neurotransistor

The results are going to be published at the International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST) on Electronics and Communications on 28 - 30 June 2023 in Athens, Greece

When using the model you are invited to cite the paper as follows: R. Schroedter et al., "A pseudo-memcapacitive neurotransistor for spiking neural networks", 2023 12th International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST), Athens, 2023, pp. 1-4
